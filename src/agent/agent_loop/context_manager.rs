//! Multi-tier auto-compaction decision engine — and the **canonical reference
//! for the whole context-budget ladder** (dirge-w5iy). The budget policy is
//! split across two cohesive modules by concern, and this is the one place
//! that documents the complete picture:
//!
//!   - **decision** (when/whether/how-hard to fold) lives here.
//!   - **mechanism** (the token estimator, per-result caps, the summarizer,
//!     and the snip override) lives in [`crate::agent::compression`].
//!
//! Faithful port of `DeepSeek-Reasonix/src/context-manager.ts` (345 lines).
//!
//! # The budget ladder
//!
//! Every threshold is a **fraction of the model's context window** (`ctx_max`),
//! compared against the current token count. In ascending order of pressure:
//!
//! | Fraction | Tier | Owner | Action |
//! |----------|------|-------|--------|
//! | 0.60 | Aggressive per-result cap | compression: [`AGGRESSIVE_CAP_THRESHOLD`] | tighten each tool-result cap (3000→1000 tok) to head off overflow *before* a fold is needed |
//! | 0.75 | Post-response fold | [`HISTORY_FOLD_THRESHOLD`] | fold older history into a summary, keep a 20% tail. Also gates the summarizer LLM call ([`should_compress`]) |
//! | 0.78 | Aggressive fold | [`HISTORY_FOLD_AGGRESSIVE_THRESHOLD`] | the normal fold didn't buy enough headroom → halve the tail budget (10%) |
//! | 0.80 | Exit-with-summary | [`FORCE_SUMMARY_THRESHOLD`] | defense in depth: force a final summary and end the turn |
//! | 0.90 | Turn-start fold | [`TURN_START_FOLD_THRESHOLD`] | before the first API call — catches a terminal prior turn, session restore, or a huge user paste |
//!
//! Plus a guard (not a pressure tier): the **min-savings check** (0.30,
//! `HISTORY_FOLD_MIN_SAVINGS_FRACTION`) skips a fold whose head wouldn't
//! shrink the log by at least that fraction.
//!
//! # One estimator, two measurement points
//!
//! There is a **single** token estimator —
//! [`compression::estimate_messages_tokens`] (`chars / CHARS_PER_TOKEN`). What
//! differs is *when* the count is taken, not *how*:
//!
//!   - **pre-send** (turn-start fold, the per-result cap tier): the local
//!     estimate, since the API hasn't been called yet;
//!   - **post-response** ([`decide_after_usage`]): the API's exact
//!     `prompt_tokens` from the usage response.
//!
//! These two numbers can legitimately disagree (the estimate is approximate);
//! that's inherent to measuring before vs. after the call, not a duplicated
//! estimator.
//!
//! # The snip override
//!
//! A pre-send "snip" ([`compression::cap_oversized_tool_results`]) can free
//! enough tokens that a *normal* post-response fold is unnecessary; the
//! suppression lives in `run.rs` via [`compression::snip_bought_enough`]
//! (a snip freeing ≥10% of the window skips a normal fold; aggressive /
//! force-summary folds always proceed). It is intentionally *not* baked into
//! [`decide_after_usage`] so the decision stays a pure function of the token
//! ratio; run.rs composes the two.
//!
//! # Tail protection: two strategies
//!
//! Recent messages are protected by **message count**
//! ([`compression::PROTECT_TAIL_DEFAULT`]) at the pruning layer, while the
//! fold tiers above express the tail as a **token fraction** of the window
//! (20% / 10%). They are not equivalent (5 messages may be 100 or 50 000
//! tokens); run.rs picks the `protect_tail` count per fold kind.
