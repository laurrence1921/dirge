//! Unified post-session learning orchestrator (dirge-ba0m).
//!
//! Before this module, `done.rs` fired three INDEPENDENT
//! fire-and-forget tasks after every idle Done:
//! - background review (writes skills + memory via tools)
//! - skills curator (mechanical lifecycle + LLM consolidation)
//! - memory curator (mechanical pass + LLM consolidation)
//!
//! They shared no state and ran concurrently, which produced a
//! cluster of races (audit finding F): a skill the review just
//! created getting archived by the curator before first use;
//! three LLM runners competing for provider rate limits at once;
//! lost-update TOCTOU on `.usage.json` / `MEMORY.md` when two
//! passes read-modify-write the same file concurrently.
//!
//! This module replaces those three spawns with ONE detached
//! task that runs the passes STRICTLY IN ORDER, awaiting each
//! before the next. Ordering is the entire coordination
//! primitive — no locks, no semaphores:
//! - the review fully completes (its `record_create` /
//!   `MEMORY.md` writes flushed) before the skills curator reads
//!   `.usage.json`, so a freshly-created skill has its
//!   `created_at` marker and is never mis-aged into Stale;
//! - at most one forked LLM runner is being drained at any
//!   instant, so the passes never compete for rate limits / cache.
//!
//! The stage list is three passes:
//!   1. background review — current-session capture
//!   2. skills curator    — consolidate skills
//!   3. memory curator    — consolidate memory
//!
//! (A cross-session extraction stage was removed in dirge-pfp2: it
//! re-derived durable facts that per-session background review already
//! captures, for the cost of an extra LLM pass.)
//!
//! Each stage is bounded by [`STAGE_TIMEOUT`] so a hung provider
//! call abandons that stage rather than stranding the rest of the
//! chain. The whole orchestrator is a single detached
//! `tokio::spawn` the user's turn never awaits — fire-and-forget
//! is preserved. Adding a future pass is one more entry in the
//! stage list — no new coordination machinery.
