//! `UiState` — the interactive event loop's data model (issue #387).
//!
//! The TUI is moving to a model-driven architecture: this struct is the
//! single source of truth for everything the event loop mutates, and the
//! rendered UI (status line, bottom input area, avatar, side panels, and
//! the deferred single paint) is derived from it as an **effect of the
//! model changing** — see [`crate::ui::render`]. Handlers update the
//! model; the loop renders once per event from the model. That replaces
//! the previous design where ~36 mutable locals were threaded through the
//! handlers and ~85 ad-hoc `render_viewport`/`draw_bottom`/`StatusLine`
//! call sites painted inline.
//!
//! Fields are grouped by concern. They are intentionally `pub(crate)` so
//! the event loop, the `run_handlers`, and the render effect can borrow
//! disjoint fields simultaneously (e.g. `&mut ui.stream` while reading
//! `&ui.loop_label`), which the borrow checker permits on distinct paths.
//!
//! NOTE: the chat scrollback buffer itself still lives in [`Renderer`]
//! (it is the *rendered* output, appended incrementally as the effect of
//! message/token/tool transitions). `UiState` holds the logical state
//! that *drives* what gets rendered, not the painted cells.
