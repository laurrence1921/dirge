//! SQLite-backed per-project declarative memory (dirge-18ks).
//!
//! Successor to the Hermes-style markdown store (`MEMORY.md` /
//! `PITFALLS.md` + `.meta.json` / `.usage.json` sidecars). Entries
//! now live in the `memories` table of the per-project session DB
//! (`.dirge/sessions/state.db`, migration v7) so sessions and
//! long-term memory share one uniform store.
//!
//! Behavior preserved from the markdown store:
//! - Frozen snapshot at session start (prefix-cache safe)
//! - Char budgets per target (model-independent)
//! - Substring matching for replace/remove (no IDs in the tool API)
//! - Injection scanning before accepting content, re-scan at
//!   prompt-render time (defense-in-depth)
//! - Salience-weighted eviction under budget pressure
//! - Duplicate rejection (case-insensitive)
//!
//! What SQLite makes obsolete: file locks + PID staleness detection,
//! external-drift detection + `.bak` snapshots, and the `.meta.json`
//! sidecar whose dual-store lost-update race silently reset entry
//! kinds (two `MemoryStore`s each saved their own startup-era copy of
//! the shared file). Metadata is now columns written in the same
//! transaction as content.
//!
//! Deliberate behavior change (audit fix): `replace` UPDATEs the row
//! in place, preserving `uid`, `created_at`, and usage lineage. The
//! markdown store minted a fresh id on every replace, so any
//! consolidation reset an entry's age tracking to zero.
